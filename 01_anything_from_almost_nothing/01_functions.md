# Functions
A function is a relation between a set of possible inputs and a set of possible
outputs.
```
f(1) = A
f(2) = B
f(3) = C
```
The input set is called `domain` and the output set `codomain`.

A function must always return the same result given the same input.
This is *not* a valid function:
```
f(1) = X
f(1) = Y
f(2) = Z
```
By contrast, this function is valid:
```
f(1) = A
f(2) = A
f(3) = A
```
